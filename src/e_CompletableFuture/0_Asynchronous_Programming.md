    Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread. 
    When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread (as well as whether the work was completed or failed). 
    There are numerous benefits to using it, such as improved application performance and enhanced responsiveness.
