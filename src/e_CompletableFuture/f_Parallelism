Parallel computing involves 
 - dividing a problem into similar kind of subproblems, 
 - solving those problems simultaneously (in parallel, with each subproblem running in a separate thread), and then 
 - combining the results of the solutions to the subproblems. 
 
 Java SE provides the fork/join framework, which enables you to more easily implement parallel computing in your applications. 
 However, with this framework, you must specify how the problems are subdivided (partitioned). 
 
 But 
 
 With aggregate operations, the Java runtime performs this partitioning and combining of solutions for you.
